# Hulu vs. Netflix: Exploring Show Data Between Platforms

This repo contains R code for generating an interactive application for exploring show data for the companies Netflix and Hulu in 2017. This includes data obtained about show ratings, number of episodes, year released and popularity. This data is limited to older data because Netflix no longer has a publically available API, the data obtained/included in this project came from third parties (see the references below). The goal of this project was to ask questions surrounding the shows available on each platform to look at larger trends and comparisons between the two companies. This project was created as an assignment for the _Technical Foundations of Informatics_ course at the UW iSchool.
